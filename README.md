# MITACS-Project
This project is my 2019 MITACS Globalink Summer Internship project. Here some synthetic 2D images are first generated to reconstruct the 3D sample for the same images. Then some pre-processing steps are applied to the original CT scan images of soil samples to perform the reconstruction of 3D images from 2D images.
